Neil Fasching
======

Hello! I’m Neil Fasching. I'm a computational social scientist and a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. I received a Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from The Wharton School in 2024.

My research has focused on public opinion, partisan animosity, political communication, and open science practices, with publications in *Science Advances*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Communication*, and *Political Psychology*, among others. This work developed my expertise in experimental design, statistical modeling, and measurement theory.

More recently, I've also become interested in AI evaluation and bias detection. My current work centers on auditing large language models to uncover systemic biases and developing robust validation frameworks to ensure AI systems perform reliably across diverse contexts. I recently published research at *ACL* on AI bias in hate speech detection. My dissertation examines how LLMs handle complex audio and text data for political podcasts, evaluating models ranging from transcription and classification to content moderation and textual embeddings.
